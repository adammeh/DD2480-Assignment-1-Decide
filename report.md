## Way of working checklist
**Principles Established**: 
Most of the principles established for the project were inherent from the course instructions. The time plan was set up with consideration to the presentation deadline. Git was chosen as version control system and Java as programming language. 

**Foundation Established**: 
Some foundations which were established to incorporate continuous integration was the maven structure. This was in order to automate the test process as well as manage and build Java applications with more ease. Some practices which were decided for git were meaningful commit messages, branching strategy based on features that were connected and code reviews before pull requests. Practises given in the instruction of the assignment were also followed. Capabilities and skill  differences between the members were discussed and analyzed through the previous assignment "Meet the Group". 

**In Use**: 
The practices and tools have been used in the assignment to do real work. Some practises were introduced and adapted in the process, for example incorporating maven structure and adapting the project accordingly. The team has so far found the pracistes and structure effective in the work. Through meetings, communication channels and code reviews, members have been able to provide feedback and advice in order to maintain way of working. 

**In Place**: 
The practices and tools are in place, and being used by the team as often as possible. Since this is still the first assignment, some practises aren't followed naturally and are occasionally forgotten. For example, linking issues to commits. Through continuous meetings, the group can evaluate progress and inspect the way of working. 

**Working well**: 
Since we are still trying to apply tools and practices and experimenting new ones we have not completed any of the requirements in this state. The tools and practices support the way we work but may not be to most optimal selection. 

**Retired**: Not applicable at current stage. 


### Current State and progression 
The teamâ€™s current state can be described somewhere between "In Use" and "In Place". We are still realising new practices we should introduce and trying to apply the practices and tools we have already established. The group felt that some of the assignment instructions were diffuse and therefore it was not clear how some practices should be applied. One example of this is invalid inputs and test cases. To transition to the next phase we need to establish which practices and tools we want to continue with and use in the future. Additionally, we need to clarify any confusion and agree on what each practice means, eg, when it is necessary to use Javadoc. Through this process, we can slowly transition into the working well stage.
